`Can Python be used to build a code inspector?`

**ChatGPT** said:
Yes! Python can be used to build a **code inspector**, which analyzes source code for errors, style violations, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

#### How a Python-Based Code Inspector Works
A Python-based code inspector typically:

- **Reads the source code** (from files or repositories).
- **Parses the code** to analyze syntax and structure.
- **Checks for errors or issues** (syntax errors, best practices, security vulnerabilities).
- **Generates reports** on findings.

#### Key Python Libraries for Code Inspection
- `ast` – Parses Python code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) for analysis.
- `pylint` – Checks for code quality, errors, and style violations.
- `flake8` – Linting tool that combines pyflakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe for better insights.
- `bandit` – Scans Python code for security vulnerabilities.
- `mypy` – Performs static type checking.
- `radon` – Measures code complexity (cyclomatic complexity).
#### Example: Simple Code Inspector Using `ast`
Here’s a basic example of analyzing Python code for function definitions:
```python
import ast

class CodeInspector(ast.NodeVisitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.functions = []

    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):
        self.functions.append(node.name)
        self.generic_visit(node)  # Continue visiting other nodes

def inspect_code(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        tree = ast.parse(file.read())
    
    inspector = CodeInspector()
    inspector.visit(tree)
    
    print(f"Functions Found: {inspector.functions}")

# Example Usage
inspect_code("example.py")
```

#### Advanced Features for a Full Code Inspector
- Check coding style using `flake8`
- Detect security risks with `bandit`
- Analyze function complexity with `radon`
- Generate HTML/PDF reports using `reportlab` or `pandas`

`Yes, let’s design a code inspector that finds broken links in a docusaurus site.`

**ChatGPT** said:
To build a code inspector for broken links in a Docusaurus site, we’ll take the following approach:

#### Design Plan
##### 1.Crawl the Docusaurus site
- Read `.md` and `.mdx` files from the `/docs` and `/blog` directories.
- Extract links from `[text](URL)` Markdown syntax and `<a href="URL"></a>` in MDX files.

##### 2.Validate URLs
- Check if links are **internal** (relative paths) or **external** (absolute URLs).
- For **internal links**, verify that the referenced `.md` file exists.
- For **external links**, send an HTTP request and check the response (200 OK or error).

##### 3.Generate a report

- List broken links with their locations.
- Provide a summary of checked vs. broken links.
---

#### Technologies & Libraries
- `os` & `pathlib` – Navigate project directories.
- `re` – Extract Markdown/MDX links using regex.
- `requests` – Validate external links.
- `aiohttp` (async) – Speed up external link checks.
- `argparse` – Allow command-line execution.

---

#### Implementation Steps
##### 1. Extract Links from Markdown & MDX Files

```python
import os
import re
from pathlib import Path

def extract_links(file_path):
    """Extract all Markdown/MDX links from a file."""
    link_pattern = r'\[.*?\]\((.*?)\)'  # Matches [text](link)
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        content = file.read()
    return re.findall(link_pattern, content)

def find_all_links(directory):
    """Scan all Markdown & MDX files for links."""
    links = {}
    for md_file in Path(directory).rglob("*.md*"):
        links[md_file] = extract_links(md_file)
    return links

# Example usage
docs_path = "path/to/docusaurus/docs"
all_links = find_all_links(docs_path)
print(all_links)
```
---

#### 2. Validate Internal Links

```python
def validate_internal_link(link, base_path):
    """Check if an internal Markdown file exists."""
    md_file = (Path(base_path) / link).with_suffix(".md")
    return md_file.exists()

def check_internal_links(links, base_path):
    """Validate all internal links."""
    broken_links = []
    for file, urls in links.items():
        for url in urls:
            if url.startswith("/") and not validate_internal_link(url, base_path):
                broken_links.append((file, url))
    return broken_links
```

---

#### 3. Validate External Links (Async for Speed)

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def check_url(url):
    """Check if an external URL is reachable."""
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(url, timeout=5) as response:
                return url, response.status
    except:
        return url, None

async def check_external_links(links):
    """Check all external links asynchronously."""
    tasks = [check_url(url) for url in links if url.startswith("http")]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

---

#### 4. Run Checks & Generate Report

```python
def generate_report(broken_internal, broken_external):
    print("\n--- Broken Internal Links ---")
    for file, link in broken_internal:
        print(f"{file}: {link}")

    print("\n--- Broken External Links ---")
    for url, status in broken_external:
        print(f"{url}: {status if status else 'No Response'}")

async def main():
    docs_path = "path/to/docusaurus/docs"
    all_links = find_all_links(docs_path)

    # Check internal links
    broken_internal = check_internal_links(all_links, docs_path)

    # Check external links
    external_links = [url for urls in all_links.values() for url in urls if url.startswith("http")]
    broken_external = await check_external_links(external_links)

    # Generate report
    generate_report(broken_internal, broken_external)

asyncio.run(main())
```

---
#### Features & Enhancements
✅ Scans all Markdown & MDX files \
✅ Validates internal links (checks if referenced `.md` files exist) \
✅ Checks external links asynchronously (faster) \
✅ Generates a report with broken links \

`Can Netlify host a Python built web application?`

**ChatGPT** said:
Netlify **cannot** directly host a Python-based web application because it is designed for static sites (HTML, CSS, JS) and does not support backend servers like Flask or Django natively. However, you have a few workarounds:

#### Workarounds for Hosting a Python Web App on Netlify
##### 1. Use Netlify for the Frontend & Host the Backend Elsewhere
- Deploy your frontend (React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS) on Netlify.
- Host the Python backend (Flask/Django) on **Render**, **Railway**, or **Fly.io**.
- Connect them via API calls.
##### 2. Convert the Python App into a Serverless API with Netlify Functions
- Use **Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda)** to run Python code.
- Example: Create an API endpoint with `lambda_handler.py`.
- Limitations: Works for small functions but not full-fledged web apps.
##### 3. Use Static Site Generators Like Pelican
- If your Python app generates static content (e.g., blogs), convert it to static HTML using **Pelican** and deploy on Netlify.
#### Recommended Alternative for Full Python Web Apps
If you want a Python-based web app with backend logic, consider:

- **Render.com** (Free tier, easy Flask/Django hosting)
- **Railway.app** (Simple, auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Fly.io** (Container-based deployment)
- **Heroku** (Still works but has limited free tiers)
